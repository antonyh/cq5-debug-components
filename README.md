cq5-debug-components
====================

Lightweight component samples that can be added to Adobe CQ5 pages to display information on the page request.

At present there's two components:

displayFormParameters - outputs the parameter _names_ submitted to the page
displayRequestAttributes - shows the _names_ of the request attributes that the component has access to.
